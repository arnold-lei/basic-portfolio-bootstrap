####Assignment 1
So this is where doing my own thing in homework assignment 1 is biting me in the ass. I am going in and hard coding all the content areas.

For some reason on my main content there is a margin on the right so the top and bottom aren't alligning correct. It's really bugging me.  I will try to fix it as much as possible.

####Assignment 2
For this assignment I decided to copy this theme: 
http://demo.fuviz.com/reen/v1-3-1/demos.html

This has been a very challenging website to do. I don't think the HTML and the CSS is the cleanest I've ever written. But I'm trying to put in as many of the features from the original template as I can.
