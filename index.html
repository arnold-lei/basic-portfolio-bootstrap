    <h1>Arnold Lei's Homework Assignment #2</h1>
      <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
        <p>So this is where doing my own thing in homework assignment 1 is biting me in the ass. I am going in and hard coding all the content areas.</p>

        <p>For some reason on my main content there is a margin on the right so the top and bottom aren't alligning correct. It's really bugging me.  I will try to fix it as much as possible.</p>
      <h2> Assignment 2</h2>
        <p>For this assignment I decided to copy this theme: </p>
        <a href="http://demo.fuviz.com/reen/v1-3-1/demos.html">http://demo.fuviz.com/reen/v1-3-1/demos.html</a>
        <p>This has been a very challenging website to do. I don't think the HTML and the CSS is the cleanest I've ever written. But I'm trying to put in as many of the features from the original template as I can. </p>
